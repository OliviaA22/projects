Summary of the Digital Health Investment Landscape session as discussed in the "Opportunities in Digital Health in Germany- The investors perspective" panel of the Digital Health Summit, held on Wednesday, 10th November, 2021 at 14.00 - 20.15pm.

The session is a panel which consist of Dr Klaus Suwelack, (who is a partner investment partner with at Johnson and Johnson); Dr. med Susanne Kreimer, (who is a managing director at Doctor.de); Engr. Kurt Höller, (a director of business and co-founder of EIT Health); as well as Min-sung Sean Kim, (a digital Health ventures investor), and led by Lucas Hofmann who is the editor of Digital Health Insight.

In the session, they mostly discussed about the necessary things that start-ups besides financial funding, should look out for trainings, expertise workshops and a broader partnership investor. From the various opinion of the panel members, it can be observed that most investors do not do financial funding for start ups but prefer to go into incorporation or partnership and that they would prefer to invest in startups who have acquired some industry expertise and a little bit of experience. 

They also looked at the digital health devices such as DIGA (these are medical devices of low-risk class intended for the purpose of detection, monitoring of low-risk diseases, as well as recognize, treat, alleviate or compensate for injuries or disabilities). It was also discussed by the panel that since it is currently inferred that “Data is the new oil”, many pharmaceutical companies are trying to get close access to these data. However, it is unfortunate that the Germany system does not support preventive measures and this might be because healthcare is free (there is no direct healthcare payment), and for patients to agree to pay for healthcare, a form of incentive need to be introduced. 

Dr Susanne mentioned that DIGA is facing the challenge of not having a hardware application device, probably due to the high standard, and recommended that doctors should start appreciating start-ups, and encourage the implementation of DIGA, which aims to open up the medical space by allowing Digital Health apps to be prescribed by doctors, just as they prescribe medications today because it is becoming highly accepted widely in other countries.

Dr Kurt Höller also stated that he supports to team up with start-ups in the form of partnership by organizing program facilitated investments just they do at the EIT Health, where they do indirect investment into start-ups mostly by teaming up with cooperate investors whose fundings are leveraged by private investors.

In conclusion, it can be said that the investors are highly interested in investing into the digital health as it seems to be a very viable area. From the viewers perspective, it can also be seen that quite a few people are aware of, or have used one or two digital health apps.
